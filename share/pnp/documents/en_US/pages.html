“pages” provide the opportunity to collect graphs of different hosts/services on one page. That way - as an example - you can display the traffic rates of all tape libraries. Regular expressions are possible so you can accomplish a lot with only few definitions - provided that you have appropriate names.
</p>

<p>
There are two ways to create “pages”. The first is by creating one or more config files with the ”.cfg” extension in the “$conf[&#039;page_dir&#039;]” directory. Comments start with a hash-sign (#) and are possible within lines as well. Each file contains a “page” definition which specifies the name of the page and it determines whether the following graph definition contains regular expressions or not.<br/>

The description behind <code>page_name</code> appears in the list of available pages and will be used as title of the browser window. <strong>Attention:</strong> “host_name” and “service_desc” refer to the name of the file in the perfdata directory, not to the definition in Nagios. Blanks are replaced by underscores (_).
</p>
<pre class="code">define page {
       use_regex 1		# 0 = use no regular expressions, 1 = use regular expressions
       page_name test-page	# page description
}</pre>

<p>
One or more “graph” definitions follow:
</p>
<pre class="code">define graph {
       host_name       host1,host2,host3
       service_desc    Current_Load
}</pre>

<p>

<strong>Attention:</strong> The list of host name will only work if you use <code>regex 0</code>!
</p>
<pre class="code">define graph {
       host_name       host4
       service_desc    Current_Users
}</pre>

<p>
And now some definitions with regular expressions. At first all hosts whose names are starting with “Tape”: 

</p>
<pre class="code">define graph {
       host_name       ^Tape
       service_desc    Traffic
}</pre>

<p>
all hosts whose names are ending with “00”:

</p>
<pre class="code">define graph {
       host_name       00$
       service_desc    Load
}</pre>

<p>
all services of localhost whose names contain “a” or “o”, respectively:

</p>
<pre class="code">define graph {
       host_name       localhost
       service_desc    a|o
}</pre>

<p>
all services whose names contain an underscore followed by (at least) three digits on all hosts whose names start with “UX”:

</p>
<pre class="code">define graph {
       host_name       ^UX
       service_desc    _\d{3}
}</pre>

<p>
In some cases you may want to limit the display to just one graph. To accomplish this you can use the optional directive “source” followed by a number specifying the position within the RRD file starting at 0:

</p>
<pre class="code">define graph {
       host_name       host1,host2,host3
       service_desc    PING
       source          1
}</pre>

<p>
There are times where the page config files are not dynamic enough. It is possible to pass the page as a json string:
</p>
<pre class="code">/pnp4nagios/page?page={"page_name": "test", "use_regex": 1, "graphs": [{"host_name": "^Tape", "service_desc": "Traffic"}]}&amp;type=json</pre>
<pre class="code">/pnp4nagios/page?page={"page_name": "test", "use_regex": 1, "graphs": [{"host_name": "^UX", "service_desc": "_\d3", "source": 1}&amp;type=json</pre>
<pre class="code">/pnp4nagios/page?page={"page_name": "test", "use_regex": 1, "graphs": [{"host_name": "^(example1.org|example2.org)$", "service_desc": ".*"}]}&amp;type=json</pre>
<pre class="code">/pnp4nagios/page?page={"page_name": "test", "use_regex": 0, "graphs": [{"host_name": "example1.org", "service_desc": "Load"},{"host_name": "example2.org", "service_desc": "Memory"}]}&amp;type=json</pre>

<p>
The same can be done when generating PDF reports for pages:
</p>
<pre class="code">/pnp4nagios/pdf/page/{"page_name": "test", "use_regex": 1, "graphs": [{"host_name": "^Tape", "service_desc": "Traffic"}]}?type=json</pre>

<p>
You may also send the “page” parameter in a POST request if it should grow to be too long to send as part of the GET request.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes images can be broken for whatever reason and will cause the entire PDF report to fail. To bypass broken images use the “skip_error” parameter:
</p>
<pre class="code">/pnp4nagios/pdf/page/{"page_name": "test", "use_regex": 1, "graphs": [{"host_name": "^Tape", "service_desc": "Traffic"}]}?type=json&amp;skip_error=true</pre>
